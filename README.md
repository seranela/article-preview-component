## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Instead of setting overflow hidden on the card itself, I set it on the containing div for the image. This allowed me to create the social popup that appears to be hovering over the card edge without clipping. It also allowed for the popup to follow the flow of the layout as opposed to letting JavaScript drive it.
